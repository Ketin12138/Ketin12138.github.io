## About Me

I am Yuhua Zhong (<span style="font-family: '楷体', 'KaiTi'; font-size: inherit;">钟宇华</span>), currently a Ph.D. student in [School of Science](https://science.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn), supervised by Asscoiate Prof. [Ce Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IBZRx3AAAAAJ&hl=en) (<span style="font-family: '楷体', 'KaiTi'; font-size: inherit;">王册</span>). Prior to that, I received my Master degree in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2023, and Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2021.

I am broadly interested in Depth Estimation, with a focus on semi-supervised learning and contrastive learning. My research aims to achieve more accurate depth prediction in low-label scenarios, providing practical and reliable solutions for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and surgical planning. 

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Depth Estimation, Depth Completion
- **Machine Learning:** Semi-supervised Learning, Contrastive Learning

## News

- **[2025-07]** My paper about Machine Learning for Sports Outcome Prediction is accepted to Scientific Reports.
